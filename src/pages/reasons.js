              Your unique and truly magnificent personality. Your personality is
              truly something special and different. Not only do you manage to
              make me smile like crazy whenever you make any comment or simply
              talk but you also manage to make me laugh whenever you make a
              joke, your sense of humor is like nothing else and I love it, and
              overall I love your personality bunches! Our personalities match
              up so well together and we play off each others commentary and
              jokes so well too. Slowly but surely our personalities are
              becoming one as you are my other half!
